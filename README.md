# hse-recommender-system-for-offline-stores

This repository includes the implementation of a recommendation system for [Chinese store data](https://www.kaggle.com/chiranjivdas09/ta-feng-grocery-dataset/version/1#) and its interface in the form of a chat bot.

 A demo version of the client's communication with the recommendation system is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq8dxKXnOAg&feature=youtu.be).
 
`Model_Comparison.ipynb` contains research on the selection of the predictive model.
`Practice_Report_Mugtasimov` is a report on the practice.
